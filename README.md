The **J**avaScript **E**xtra **B**eautifier takes your obfuscated or minified JavaScript and performs a pre-processing step to enhance the final output from actual JS Beautifiers such as [JSBeautifier](http://jsbeautifier.org/) ([source](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify)).

## Development

`npm install` then run tests with `mocha`.
